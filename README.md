# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on **detecting fake news articles** using **Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. With the rise of misinformation, this model helps classify news as **real or fake** based on textual content.  

This was my **first task as an intern**, giving me hands-on experience in **text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation**.  

## 📌 Dataset
- **Source:** Dataset consists of **18,000 real** and **20,000 fake** news articles.  
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword Removal
  - TF-IDF Vectorization

## 🏗 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data Handling  
  - `nltk`, `sklearn` – Text Processing & Feature Engineering  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data Visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine Learning Models  

## ⚙️ Model Training & Evaluation
- **Machine Learning Models Implemented:**
  - Logistic Regression  

- **Performance Metrics Used:**
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  

## 🚀 Results & Learnings
✅ Improved understanding of **text classification techniques**  
✅ Enhanced **feature extraction & model evaluation** skills  
✅ Learned how **ML helps combat misinformation**
